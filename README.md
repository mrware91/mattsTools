### Author: Matt Ware
### Description:
These are short-cut tools that I've found useful in my own work.

### tileOperations.py
Often times, you want to multiply / subtract / etc a vector row/column-wise
with a matrix. These functions allow you to do that.

### plotStyles.py
My preferred plot styles.

### picklez.py
My own verison of pickle the load and saves Pytohn objects.
